I contribute to the open source project, Drupal, where I am co-maintainer of the core experimental module, Help Topics. During the pandemic, we stopped eating out, which means that I am continually learning new cooking skills, techniques, and recipes (not to mention rockin' the Drive Up and Go\u2122 at my local Safeway). I play the accordion. I take weekly lessons and am also learning to arrange music for accordion. I've been learning to use MuseScore as part of that. I crochet, but not as much as I used to. I do teach my nephew how to crochet over Zoom though, which has been a lot of fun. I have a technical background as a web developer and I've been known to tinker with electronics from time to time. It's something I wish I had more time to do. I read a lot. Tutorials, documentation, novels, The Internet, non-fiction, in that order (usually). I enjoy gardening, photography, and camping, but I don't always get to it. I wish I had more time to practice writing. Which is one of the reasons why I made this site.<\/p>",
